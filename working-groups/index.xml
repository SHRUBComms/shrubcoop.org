      <description>Swap, donate or buy affordable and high quality preloved clothing, books, shoes, bags, bric-a-brac and household items.
Anyone is welcome to buy or donate items. Become a member and you can swap your items in exchange for tokens to use in-store.
How It Works! Our vision is for a world without waste. Choosing second hand helps to save carbon emissions and supports a sustainable lifestyle.
Unlike your ordinary charity shop, when you donate your preloved items we give you back 25% of their value as tokens.</description>
