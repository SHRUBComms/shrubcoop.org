SHRUB has evolved - right now is a really exciting time in our history, we've just expanded to our new location on Bread Street, opened a new upcycling workshop, and reinvented the Wee Spoke Hub.

We've organised an evening of speakers and live entertainment, as well as interactive stalls showcasing our different projects.

There will be...
Upcycling activities,
DIY bike maintenance advice from the The Wee Spoke Hub,
Nibbles provided by Food Sharing Edinburgh, and refreshments available from the brand new SHRUB Caf√©!

And of course, the chance to browse the Swapshop and grab yourself a bargain!

Registration is FREE, however, there is a limited space, so book your tickets ASAP.
