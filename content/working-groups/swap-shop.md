**Swap**, **donate** or **buy** affordable and high quality preloved clothing, books, shoes, bags, bric-a-brac and household items.

Anyone is welcome to buy or donate items. **Become a member** and you can swap your items in exchange for tokens to use in-store.

## How It Works!

Our vision is for a world without waste. Choosing second hand helps to save carbon emissions and supports a sustainable lifestyle.

Unlike your ordinary charity shop, when you donate your preloved items we give you back 25% of their value as tokens. You can spend these at any time in the Swapshop. 1 token is worth £1.

When you drop off your items, our friendly volunteers will value them and add tokens to your account within 7 days.

## Our Impact

The **Swapshop** has saved **124 tonnes** of CO2 emissions so far.

In 2016 it is estimated that **1,130,000 tonnes** of clothing was purchased in the UK. _(Wrap, 2017)_ That’s the equivalent of **23 million tonnes** of CO2 emissions.

UK households binned 300,000 tonnes of clothing in 2016. _(The Guardian, 2017)_

“Extending the life of clothes offers the greatest overall potential across carbon, water, and waste targets. This can be achieved by designing clothes to be more durable, and by encouraging re-use through sales of second hand clothing”. _(Wrap, 2017)_
