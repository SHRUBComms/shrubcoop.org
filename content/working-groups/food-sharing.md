# What is food sharing all about?

Food Sharing Edinburgh was established in Edinburgh in late 2013, and is now rapidly expanding, based on a very similar concept operating in Germany. 

The Food Sharing project connects people so they can exchange their excess food instead of throwing it away and wasting it.

Volunteers can collect food from businesses and redistribute it around the community to friends, family, neighbours, charities, poor, homeless and shelters. 

Unlike food banks, there is no barrier or specific level of income that Food Sharing works for, it is an inclusive network for people from all social, economic and backgrounds. This project has grown out of its original goal of just saving food from going to waste into something much more.

15 million tonnes of food is wasted annually in the UK, according to a government funded research report. Of this, 48% occurs at a house-hold level…so we are all working hard to lower this statistic.

Our activity operates via a Facebook group and social media which can be found here. (insert Facebook link)
