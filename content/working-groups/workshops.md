We host workshops to teach such skills as how to make:

- Wallets out of bicycle inner tubes or tetra pacs
- Hula hoops out of water piping
- Chandeliers out of bicycle wheels
- Jewellery out of bicycle inner tubes or paper
- Backyard wind turbines out of aluminium printing sheets
- Mudguards out of plastic bottles.

… and much more!

As well as the practical workshops, we host inspiring discussions and talks about environmental and social issues related to climate change, activism, waste and social justice.

Examples of workshops include: 

Transformation Tuesday: bring an unloved piece of clothing and learn how to use material and imagination to turn it into something completely different: your baggy shirt could be a crop top, pyjama shorts or even just a slightly more fitted shirt. We’ll provide the sewing machines, a basic haberdashery, advice and ideas.

and 

Wool Wednesday: knitting, spinning, felting, weaving and crochet!

So much waste comes about due to a lack of skills to repair or create something new and useful out of what is available. Its often beautiful and imaginative to see the limitless potential in every object.

We’re always looking for new facilitators and volunteers with skills to share with the community. If that’s you then get in touch with us at shrubworkshop@gmail.com 

We’d love to hear from you!
