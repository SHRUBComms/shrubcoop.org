Our Swapshop and Freeshop projects are run for the community to save waste and stop items being sent to landfill.

We estimate that it has saved over 75 tons of items from landfill over the past 10 years,with last year saving over 15 tons!

The Swapshop allows people to Buy items for cash or Shrub-Tokens in store: volunteers will check cash values by looking up the cheapest online price and using this as a guide.

Selling items to the Swapshop is fairly simple too: bring in an item and a lovely volunteer will value it in Shrub-tokens, you can then look around the shop and spend your tokens or part-cash/part tokens on the great items that others in the community have swapped in! 

Non-members can do all their shopping on-the-day, but if you want to save your tokens for another day, or build them up over time, become a Shrub member! 

Sign up for as little as £1 per month (£12 per year) and get stuff for up to 20% off the non-member price. Plus access to the Members’year-round Freeshop!

If you have a few hours spare a week to become a Shrub volunteer and can help with his wonderful project, please drop us a email to: joe.thompson@shrubcoop.org or drop in to the shop!


Volunteers get 3 tokens per hour of time given to spend in our store.

In  addition, we collaborate with the University of Edinburgh and our partners Bright Green Initiative to provide end-of-term collections for students. 

We spend the last week of May & first week of June each year collecting up all the stuff that students would otherwise throw away, sort it, weigh it, and store it over the summer for reuse.
