      <description>Swap, donate or buy affordable and high quality preloved clothing, books, shoes, bags, bric-a-brac and household items.
Anyone is welcome to buy or donate items. Become a member and you can swap your items in exchange for tokens to use in-store.
How It Works! Our vision is for a world without waste. Choosing second hand helps to save carbon emissions and supports a sustainable lifestyle.
Unlike your ordinary charity shop, when you donate your preloved items we give you back 25% of their value as tokens.</description>

      <description>SHRUB has evolved - right now is a really exciting time in our history, we&amp;rsquo;ve just expanded to our new location on Bread Street, opened a new upcycling workshop, and reinvented the Wee Spoke Hub.
We&amp;rsquo;ve organised an evening of speakers and live entertainment, as well as interactive stalls showcasing our different projects.
There will be&amp;hellip; Upcycling activities, DIY bike maintenance advice from the The Wee Spoke Hub, Nibbles provided by Food Sharing Edinburgh, and refreshments available from the brand new SHRUB Caf√©!</description>
