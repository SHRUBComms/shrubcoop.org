      <description>The Food Sharing Hub is Scotland’s first rescued food shop and exists to save surplus food from supermarkets from an unnecessary fate in the bin.
Simply come along to the Food Sharing Hub and sign up as a member of SHRUB Coop for as little as £1 a month. As a member you can fill one basket of food per day and pay as you feel.
How it works The Food Sharing Hub is working with Tesco, Co-op and Waitrose to collect food from 6 local supermarkets.</description>

      <description>What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description>

      <description>SHRUB has evolved - right now is a really exciting time in our history, we&amp;rsquo;ve just expanded to our new location on Bread Street, opened a new upcycling workshop, and reinvented the Wee Spoke Hub.
We&amp;rsquo;ve organised an evening of speakers and live entertainment, as well as interactive stalls showcasing our different projects.
There will be&amp;hellip; Upcycling activities, DIY bike maintenance advice from the The Wee Spoke Hub, Nibbles provided by Food Sharing Edinburgh, and refreshments available from the brand new SHRUB Café!</description>
