      <description>SHRUB has evolved - right now is a really exciting time in our history, we&amp;rsquo;ve just expanded to our new location on Bread Street, opened a new upcycling workshop, and reinvented the Wee Spoke Hub.
We&amp;rsquo;ve organised an evening of speakers and live entertainment, as well as interactive stalls showcasing our different projects.
There will be&amp;hellip; Upcycling activities, DIY bike maintenance advice from the The Wee Spoke Hub, Nibbles provided by Food Sharing Edinburgh, and refreshments available from the brand new SHRUB Caf√©!</description>
